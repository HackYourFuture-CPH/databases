In the first version of this homework, we are using the package 'mysql' to connect to the 'hyf' database.
We are also using Node's core module 'readline' to receive an SQL query input as a command line string and present the response from the db on the command line as output.

Even though there are two other files called query.js and query.sql in the folder, they do not serve any purpose in this version. In the next version, I will attempt to put them to use by reading queries one by one from either of these files and then writing the response to a text file within the folder.
